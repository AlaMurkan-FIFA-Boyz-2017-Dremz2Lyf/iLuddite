const React = require('react');

const AuthorBio = (props) => {
  //Response.data is an object. Need to render the author info and also add his image to a portion of the modal or page or whatever
  //I am rendering.  Pass down those props to this component and create the modal in here. Then oon hover we will want to mount this component
  //Or on click?  Might want the searchAuthor to run when the component mounts so that we will already have made the api call
  //But then we would need to store it to the database once that call has been made (which is already taken care of in that route)
  //Then on hover get the props of the current author down to.
